Project Title: Customer Sales Analysis Dashboard
Brief Project Report
This project involves designing a business analytics dashboard to help a fictional retail company analyze customer sales performance. The dashboard will feature key sales metrics, customer segmentation insights, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to equip decision-makers with a comprehensive overview of customer behaviors, high-performing products, and regions that drive the most revenue. A modern dashboard design will ensure that all insights are accessible immediately.
Dataset Creation
We’ll create a dummy dataset based on the following fields, simulating monthly customer sales over two years:

•	Order ID: Unique identifier for each sale.

•	Order Date: Date of each sale.

•	Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

•	Product Category: Category of the product sold (e.g., Electronics, Apparel, Furniture).

•	Product Name: Name of the product sold.

•	Quantity Sold: Number of units sold per order.

•	Unit Price: Price per unit of the product.

•	Total Sales: Calculated as Quantity Sold * Unit Price.

•	Region: Geographic region of the customer (e.g., North, South, East, West)


This dataset will include around 1,000 rows to give a good range of data to analyze.
